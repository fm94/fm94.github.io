Well, I've been busy with work for a year... I am glad to announce that I've finally obtained my PhD and currently focusing more on machine learning (which is now called AI - a thing that I don't like but yeah, whatever!). I've now added some reporsitories and ideas that I've been working on in my free time recently.
