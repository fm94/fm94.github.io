New year and a new idea. Checkout the <a href="https://github.com/fm94/ImageLookup">ImageLookup</a> repository on my Github. It's an implementation of an idea that performs fast image lookup based on similarity. Imagine you have an image or subimage and have a huge database of reference images, use this to find the best match quickly.
