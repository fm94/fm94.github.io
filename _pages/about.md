Hello there, I am `Fares`, and welcome to my small space. I am a `deep learning and software engineer`. I also do `astrophotography` in my spare time, build small embedded `electronic` projects, and read. I am also a researcher at the Technical University of Vienna (TU Wien), where I mainly focus on `applied machine learning` for cyber security and `anomaly detection` in communication networks.

I share my thoughts, publications, hobby projects, and more on this website. Be aware that I only share my own thoughts and opinion, so don't be offended if you do not share the same idea. Enjoy!

Please let me know if anything can be improved or if you wish to discuss my ideas/posts.
