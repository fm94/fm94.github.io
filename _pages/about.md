Hello there, I am `Fares`, and welcome to my small space. I am a `deep learning researcher and computer vision software engineer`. I also do `astrophotography` in my spare time, build small embedded `electronic` projects, and read. I've been a researcher at the Technical University of Vienna (TU Wien), where I obtained my PhD and mainly focused on `applied machine learning` for cyber security and `anomaly detection` in communication networks.

I share my thoughts, publications, hobby projects, and more on this website. Be aware that I only share my own thoughts and opinion, so don't be offended if you do not share the same opinion. Enjoy!

Wish to discuss/share ideas? contact me at meghfares@hotmail.com.
